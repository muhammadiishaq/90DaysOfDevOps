# 90 Days DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan.

## Current Level....
#### Me Muhammad Ishaq, 
I am committed  for the next 90 days to learning DevOps fundamentals step by step. I am a beginner / fresher with basic IT knowledge. I am new to DevOps and Cloud but serious about learning and building a career in this field.

## What is DevOps...
I understand DevOps as a culture where development and operations work together to build, test, deploy, and maintain applications smoothly. Cloud computing helps us use servers and services over the internet without managing hardware, which makes systems faster and scalable.

## Why..
I am learning DevOps and Cloud because I want to become job ready and confident in modern technologies. I want to move from theory to practical learning and build projects that I can show during interviews.

## How..
In the 90 days, my goal is to be confident with Linux basics, Git, and networking fundamentals. I also want to build project CI/CD pipelines, create Docker images, and deploy a simple application on Kubernetes using basic cloud services.

During this journey, I want to focus on building core DevOps skills. These are troubleshooting, finding solution, tools, Cloud (AWS and Azure), CI/CD pipeline creation, and Docker and Kubernetes or other related tools fundamentals. These skills will form the foundation of my DevOps career.

## Time Commitment..
I will dedicate around 4 to 6 hours every day for learning and practice. On weekends, I will spend more then 6 hours revising concepts, completing hands-on Task, and working on small projects to strong my concept.

## Final Commitment..
To stay disciplined, I will follow the TrainWithShubham DevOps roadmap, practice daily, push my work to GitHub, and review my progress weekly. This 90 day plan is my personal commitment to consistency, learning, and becoming a DevOps engineer.

### Happy Learning...
